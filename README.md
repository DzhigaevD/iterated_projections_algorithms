Basic script for visualizing of optimization algorithms, which are commonly used in phase retrieval problems appearing in coherent diffractive microscopy.
Current implementation includes: 
- Error-Reduction (ER)
- Solvent Flipping (SF)
- Hybrid Input-Output (HIO)
- Difference Map (DM)

Usage:
- Run the script RUN_ME.m
- Select the algorithm by assigning corresponding value to variable 'algorithm'
- Draw two constraint sets with a freehand tool
- Click anywhere in the field to create an initial guess for the solution
- Hopefully algorithm find the solution at the intersection of two sets =)
